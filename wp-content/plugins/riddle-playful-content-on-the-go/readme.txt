== Changelog ==
= 3.11 =
* Bug fix. When adding a quiz to a post that contained the % character, the Riddle embed would cause errors. We found and squashed that nasty bug. HT to @richaber who found that bug and spend a lot of time helping us to replicate it. Much appreciated!

= 3.1 =
* Fully integrated the quiz making experience into the Admin Backend

= 3.06 =
* we removed the „Add Riddle“ button from the post editor. The button was running into trouble with high end page builders like WP Bakery Visual Composer or Avada’s Fusion editor. To add Riddles to your posts going forward just use the shortcode from the publish screen of your Riddle

= 3.05 =
* we noticed a strange behavior when using the popular JetPack plugin’s notification feature. Essentially trying to connect to Riddle would throw you into an endless loop. As these are never fun, we quickly fixed that and Riddle plays nicely with JetPack now.

= 3.04 =
* changes to how content is pulled from riddle.com

= 3.03 =
* fixed an issue with some high end themes that use custom builders such as Divi or Avada

= 3.02 =
* squashed another annoying little bug that prevented the „add Riddle“ button in the post editor to load Riddles if a previous version of the plugin was still locally cached.

= 3.01 =
* Fixed a bug where the Riddle plugin did not play nice with themes like Divi and Avada. In some instances, the Riddle plugin prohibited advanced editors used by these themes to function properly. 

= 3.0 = 
* A complete re-write of the Riddle Quiz Plugin.
* Riddle is now fully integrated with the Wordpress Backend
* Sign up for an account, and create/edit your Riddles all directly from within Wordpress
* New publishing option to create a new post to which the Riddle is auto-added
* Riddle button in your editor to select a Riddle to add to your posts or pages

= 2.3 =
* updated help documentation
* bugfixes when connecting to Riddle using the Riddle token

= 2.2 =
* bugfixes

= 2.1 =
